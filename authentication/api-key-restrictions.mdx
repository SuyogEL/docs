### IP Address Restrictions

You can enhance security by limiting which IP addresses can use your API keys:

1. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your OppiWallet dashboard
2. Select the API key you want to restrict
3. Click on **IP Restrictions**
4. Add the specific IP addresses or ranges that should have access
5. Save your changes

IP restrictions help prevent unauthorized use even if your API keys are compromised.

### Key Activation Management

OppiWallet lets you quickly enable or disable API keys directly from the mobile app:

1. Open the OppiWallet mobile application
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
3. Toggle the switch next to any key to enable or disable it

This feature allows you to:
- Quickly disable keys if you suspect unauthorized access
- Temporarily disable keys during maintenance periods
- Enable keys only when needed for specific operations

### Best Practices

- **Regularly review** active API keys and their restrictions
- **Implement the principle of least privilege** by creating keys with specific permissions
- **Set up alerts** for unusual API activity patterns
- **Rotate keys** periodically, especially for high-security integrations

### Additional Security Options

Consider implementing these additional security measures:
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Request logging** for audit purposes
- **Webhook notifications** for key usage events
