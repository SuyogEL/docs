### Auth Key Overview

- **Function**: The Auth Key serves as your identifier when making API requests to OppiWallet
- **Usage**: You must include this key with every API request
- **Visibility**: This can be considered similar to a public key

### Implementation

When making requests to the OppiWallet API, include your Auth Key in the request headers:

```javascript
const headers = {
  'x-auth-key': 'YOUR_AUTH_KEY',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### Purpose

The Auth Key allows OppiWallet's systems to:
- Identify which registered user is making the request
- Associate the request with your specific API integration
- Apply the correct permissions and rate limits to your requests

### Security Considerations

While the Auth Key is similar to a public key, you should still:
- Avoid unnecessarily exposing it in client-side code
- Follow proper API key management practices
- Use environment variables to store the key in your applications
