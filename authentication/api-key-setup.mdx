### Creating API Keys

1. **Register an account** with OppiWallet.
2. **Go to the API section** on the OppiWallet home page.
3. **Generate API keys** as needed:
   - You can create multiple API keys for different applications.
   - Each API key consists of an **Auth Key** and an **Enc Key**.

### Approval Process

- New API keys require **admin approval**.
- You'll receive a notification upon approval.
- Once approved, integrate the keys into your system.

### Integration Details

- **API Base URL**: `https://doc-api.oppiwallet.com/api`
- Use your API keys in requests as per the [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) guidelines.

### Security Best Practices

- **Do not share** API keys publicly.
- **Store securely** in environment variables or vaults.
- If compromised:
  - Delete affected keys
  - Generate new keys
  - Update integrations
