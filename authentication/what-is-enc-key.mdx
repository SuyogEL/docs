### Enc Key Overview

- **Function**: The Enc Key is used to create and sign JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API requests
- **Usage**: Used to cryptographically sign requests to verify their authenticity
- **Visibility**: This should be treated as a private key and kept secure

### Implementation

To use your Enc Key properly:

```javascript
// Example of creating a JWT using the Enc Key
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

// Payload for your API request
const payload = {
  // Your request data
};

// Create a signed JWT using your Enc Key
const token = jwt.sign(payload, 'YOUR_ENC_KEY', { 
  algorithm: 'HS256',
  expiresIn: '1h'
});

// Include this token in your request
```

### Purpose

The Enc Key enables OppiWallet's systems to:
- Verify the authenticity of your requests
- Ensure data integrity during transmission
- Prevent unauthorized access to your account's functionality

### Security Considerations

Since the Enc Key functions similarly to a private key:

- **Never share** your Enc Key with third parties
- **Store securely** in environment variables or secure key management services
- **Rotate keys** periodically as part of security best practices
- If your Enc Key is accidentally exposed:
  1. Delete the compromised key immediately
  2. Create a new key pair
  3. Update all integrations with the new keys
